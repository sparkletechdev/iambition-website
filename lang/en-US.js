        `The development of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, 
        Internet of Things, and 5G networks has significantly changed our way of life. 
        Existing security monitoring methods can no longer meet the digital 
        transformation needs of enterprises in the post-epidemic era. Therefore, 
        a group of elites with international vision, experience in the ICT industry, 
        and forward-looking technical capabilities established "iAmbition Technology" in 
        May 2020 based on the mission of "safer for life and better for life".`,
